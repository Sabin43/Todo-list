this is a simple project i have tried doing by following a youtube video. i did this to make my concepts clear about the various react topics. 

there are still some flaws in this react app. 

however my primary motive to understand how various things integrate and function in a react app has been fulfilled.

for this code to run on your device, you have to install the 'node modules'first.
